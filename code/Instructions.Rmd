## Your assignment

The goals for this assignment are to:

- introduce simulation as a means of understanding complicated models
- explore how scale affects the interpretation of spatial processes
- fit a model based on spatial covariates

_By the end of the assignment_ you should have a publication-quality static map and a functional interactive map


# Task 1: Load your libraries and simulate some points
Following the example load the necessary packages and simulate 4 different point processes. One should be completely spatially random, the other 3 should involve changing the function used create different spatial patterns of points.


# Task 2: Use quadrat counts to test for spatial randomness
Use at least 3 different grains for your quadrats and conduct the Chi-square test on your points for each grain. 

_Question 1:_ How does changing the grain size affect your results? Were any of the processes you simulated insensitive to the choice of grain? Why might this be?


# Task 3: Simulate a regression outcome
Following the example, simulate a regression outcome based on known relations between your predictor and the outcome and a known relative buffer size.

# Task 4: Fit a model 
make sure that you get the correct result back.

# Task 5: Experiement with different buffer sizes
Now generate new dataframes (leaving the outcome alone) based on 3 different buffer sizes and refit your model. 

_Question 2:_How does changing your buffer size affect your ability to get the proper parameter estimate back?
